**Care Tips:**

1. **Light Requirements:** Provide bright, indirect light for your Pinstriped Houseplant. Avoid exposing it to direct sunlight, as it can scorch the leaves.

2. **Humidity:** Calatheas, including the Pinstriped variety, appreciate high humidity levels. Regular misting, using a humidity tray, or placing the plant in a well-humidified room can help maintain the humidity it needs.

3. **Watering:** Keep the soil consistently moist, but avoid waterlogging. The plant may respond negatively to hard water, so consider using filtered or distilled water.

4. **Fertilization:** Feed your Pinstriped Houseplant with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season (spring and summer) every 4-6 weeks.

5. **Leaves Movement:** The Pinstriped Houseplant is known for its unique feature of opening and closing its leaves in response to light. This natural behavior is known as "praying" or "sleeping" and adds to its charm.

The Pinstriped Houseplant's visually striking foliage and its ability to respond to light make it an engaging and beautiful addition to indoor spaces. Remember that it's important to maintain the right moisture levels to prevent the leaf edges from browning or curling.
