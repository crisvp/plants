**Care Tips:**

1. **Light Requirements:** Parlor Palms thrive in low to moderate, indirect light. Avoid exposing them to direct sunlight, as it can scorch the leaves.

2. **Watering:** Keep the soil consistently moist, but not waterlogged. Water when the top inch of soil feels slightly dry.

3. **Humidity:** While they can tolerate average humidity levels, higher humidity can encourage better growth and overall health.

4. **Fertilization:** Feed your Parlor Palm with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season (spring and summer) every 4-6 weeks.

5. **Pruning:** Remove any yellowing or damaged fronds to maintain the plant's appearance and allow new growth to flourish.

Parlor Palms are relatively low-maintenance and can adapt well to various indoor conditions. Their compact size and tolerance for lower light levels make them a versatile choice for homes and offices. Keep an eye out for signs of overwatering or underwatering, as getting the right balance is crucial for their well-being.
