**Care Tips:**

1. **Light Requirements:** Provide your Chinese Money Plant with bright, indirect light. Avoid exposing it to direct sunlight, as it can scorch the leaves.

2. **Watering:** Allow the top inch of soil to dry out before watering again. Overwatering can lead to root rot, so it's best to err on the side of slightly underwatering.

3. **Propagation:** Chinese Money Plants are known for producing "pups" or offsets around the base of the plant. These can be carefully separated and potted to create new plants.

4. **Fertilization:** Feed your Chinese Money Plant with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season (spring and summer) every 4-6 weeks.

5. **Leaf Orientation:** The leaves of the Chinese Money Plant can rotate toward the light, so make sure to turn the pot periodically to encourage even growth.

Chinese Money Plants are not only visually appealing but also relatively low-maintenance, making them a great choice for both experienced plant enthusiasts and beginners. Their compact size and distinctive appearance make them an attractive addition to various interior settings.
