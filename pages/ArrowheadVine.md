**Care Tips:**

1. **Light Requirements:** Arrowhead Vines thrive in bright, indirect light, but they can tolerate lower light conditions. Avoid direct sunlight, as it can scorch the leaves.

2. **Watering:** Keep the soil consistently moist, but not waterlogged. Wilting leaves can indicate the plant needs water.

3. **Humidity:** These plants appreciate higher humidity levels. Misting the leaves or using a humidity tray can help maintain the humidity they prefer.

4. **Pruning:** Regularly pinch or trim the plant to encourage bushier growth and remove any leggy or faded growth.

5. **Climbing Support:** If you want your Arrowhead Vine to climb, provide it with a support structure or trellis to guide its growth.

Arrowhead Vines are adaptable and versatile, making them suitable for various indoor settings. With proper care, they can thrive and add a touch of elegance to your living space. Keep in mind that some Arrowhead Vine varieties can be toxic if ingested, so take precautions if you have pets or small children.
