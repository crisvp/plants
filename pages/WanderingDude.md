It's also commonly referred to as the "Wandering Jew" plant, although this name is considered less appropriate due to its historical connotations.

**Care Tips:**

1. **Light Requirements:** Provide bright, indirect light for your Wandering Dude. Some direct morning sunlight can be beneficial, but avoid strong afternoon sun.

2. **Watering:** Keep the soil consistently moist, but avoid waterlogging. Wilting leaves can indicate the plant needs water.

3. **Humidity:** Wandering Dudes appreciate higher humidity levels. Misting the leaves or using a humidity tray can help maintain the humidity they prefer.

4. **Propagation:** These plants are easy to propagate through stem cuttings. Simply place the cuttings in water or soil to encourage root growth.

5. **Pruning:** Prune your plant to encourage bushier growth and to remove any leggy or faded growth.

Wandering Dudes are popular for their fast growth and colorful foliage. They are relatively low-maintenance and can adapt well to various indoor conditions. Just be cautious if you have pets, as some pets might be attracted to chewing on the leaves, and the plant's sap can be mildly irritating.
