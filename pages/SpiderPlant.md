# **Spider Plant** (_Chlorophytum comosum_)

Spider plants are popular indoor houseplants known for their graceful arching leaves and easy care requirements. They are native to South Africa and have become a favorite choice for both novice and experienced plant enthusiasts due to their adaptability and air-purifying qualities.

**Plant Description:**

Spider plants feature long, slender leaves that are typically green with white or creamy stripes running along the edges. The arching leaves resemble the shape of spider legs, which gives the plant its common name. These plants are often grown in hanging baskets or placed on shelves, allowing their foliage to cascade gracefully.

**Care Tips:**

1. **Light Requirements:** Spider plants thrive in bright, indirect light. Avoid direct sunlight, as it can scorch the leaves.

2. **Watering:** Allow the top inch of soil to dry out before watering again. Overwatering can lead to root rot, so it's better to slightly underwater than overwater.

3. **Humidity:** Spider plants appreciate moderate humidity levels. Mist the leaves occasionally or place the plant near a tray of water to increase humidity.

4. **Fertilization:** During the growing season (spring and summer), feed the plant with a balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks to encourage healthy growth.

5. **Pest Control:** Keep an eye out for common houseplant pests like spider mites. Regularly inspect the undersides of the leaves and treat any infestations promptly.

Spider plants are generally low-maintenance and make great options for beginners or for those looking to expand their indoor plant collection. Their air-purifying qualities and attractive foliage make them a versatile choice for various home environments.
