**Care Tips:**

1. **Light Requirements:** Snake plants can tolerate a range of light conditions, from low light to bright indirect light. However, they grow best in indirect light.

2. **Watering:** Allow the soil to dry out between watering, as snake plants are susceptible to root rot if overwatered.

3. **Humidity:** Snake plants can tolerate low humidity levels, making them suitable for various indoor environments.

4. **Fertilization:** Feed your snake plant with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength every 2-3 months during the growing season (spring and summer).

5. **Air Purification:** Snake plants are known for their ability to filter indoor air, making them a great choice for improving indoor air quality.

Snake plants are excellent options for beginners and can thrive even with minimal care. They come in various sizes and leaf patterns, allowing you to choose the one that best fits your space and preferences.
