# **Norfolk Island Pine** (_Araucaria heterophylla_)

The Norfolk Island Pine, scientifically known as _Araucaria heterophylla_, is a distinctive evergreen tree that's often grown as a houseplant during the holiday season. Despite its name, it's not a true pine but belongs to the Araucariaceae family.

**Plant Description:**

Norfolk Island Pines have a conical shape with tiers of branches covered in dark green, needle-like leaves. These branches give the plant a symmetrical appearance, similar to that of a traditional Christmas tree. While they can grow quite large in their natural habitat, they are often kept as smaller potted plants indoors.

**Care Tips:**

1. **Light Requirements:** Provide bright, indirect light for your Norfolk Island Pine. Some direct morning sunlight can be beneficial, but avoid strong afternoon sun.

2. **Watering:** Keep the soil consistently moist, but avoid letting the plant sit in standing water. Watering needs may decrease in the winter.

3. **Humidity:** These trees appreciate higher humidity levels, especially during the winter when indoor air can be dry.

4. **Fertilization:** Feed your Norfolk Island Pine with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength every 4-6 weeks during the growing season.

5. **Pruning:** Remove any brown or dead branches or needles to maintain the plant's appearance.

Norfolk Island Pines can be lovely seasonal decorations during the holidays and can also be grown as long-term houseplants. Keep in mind that these trees can eventually outgrow indoor spaces, so be prepared to provide the necessary space or consider transitioning them to an outdoor location in a suitable climate.
