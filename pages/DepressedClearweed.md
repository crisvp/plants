# **Depressed Clearweed** (_Pilea pumila_)

Depressed Clearweed, scientifically known as _Pilea pumila_, is a small herbaceous plant native to North America. It's a member of the Urticaceae family, which also includes other well-known plants like stinging nettles.

**Plant Description:**

Depressed Clearweed is a delicate and low-growing plant that typically reaches a height of around 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 cm). It gets its common name "depressed" from its leaves, which are flat and somewhat droopy, appearing almost pressed to the ground. The leaves are toothed along the edges and have a slightly wavy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often greenish or yellowish in color.
