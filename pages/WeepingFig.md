**Care Tips:**

1. **Light Requirements:** Weeping Figs prefer bright, indirect light. Avoid sudden changes in light conditions, as they can cause leaf drop.

2. **Watering:** Water the plant when the top inch of soil feels slightly dry. However, overwatering can lead to root rot, so ensure proper drainage.

3. **Humidity:** Higher humidity levels can benefit the Weeping Fig, especially in dry indoor environments. Mist the leaves or use a humidifier if necessary.

4. **Pruning:** Regular pruning can help maintain the plant's shape and remove any dead or yellowing leaves.

5. **Fertilization:** During the growing season, feed your Weeping Fig with a balanced liquid fertilizer every 4-6 weeks.

Weeping Figs can be a bit finicky and may react to changes in their environment, such as moving them to a new spot or adjusting their light exposure. With proper care and attention, they can make stunning indoor focal points, but their sensitivity may require a bit of patience.

_Please note that Weeping Figs can produce a milky sap that may irritate the skin, so handle them carefully._
