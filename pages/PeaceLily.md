# **Peace Lily** (_Spathiphyllum spp._)

The Peace Lily, scientifically known as _Spathiphyllum_, is a popular and elegant houseplant known for its glossy green leaves and distinctive white blooms. It's not only aesthetically pleasing but also known for its air-purifying qualities.

**Plant Description:**

The Peace Lily features dark green, lance-shaped leaves that arch gracefully. What makes this plant particularly attractive is its white spathes, which are modified leaves that surround the actual flowers. These spathes contrast beautifully against the dark foliage. The Peace Lily's flowers are typically white and have a delicate, pleasant fragrance.

**Care Tips:**

1. **Light Requirements:** Peace Lilies thrive in indirect light. Avoid exposing them to direct sunlight, as it can scorch the leaves.

2. **Watering:** Water the plant when the top inch of soil feels slightly dry. Peace Lilies are sensitive to overwatering, so it's better to err on the side of underwatering.

3. **Humidity:** While they can tolerate average humidity levels, higher humidity will encourage better growth and more vibrant flowers.

4. **Fertilization:** Feed your Peace Lily with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season (spring and summer) every 4-6 weeks.

5. **Blooming:** The plant's spathes may brown and die after blooming. Trim them off to encourage new growth and potentially more blooms.

Peace Lilies are excellent air purifiers and can thrive in low-light conditions, making them suitable for offices and homes with limited natural light. However, it's important to note that Peace Lilies are toxic if ingested, so keep them out of reach of pets and children.

_Ingesting any part of the Peace Lily can cause irritation and discomfort, so it's important to handle them with care._
